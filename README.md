# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python

In this , I are building a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, I am using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction. 
I will be doing our prediction in Python Programming in Jupyter Notebook.
